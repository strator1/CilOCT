# CilOCT: A software for semi-automatic segmentation and analysis of the ciliary muscle in OCT images

Presbyopia and myopia research show a growing interest in ciliary muscle (CM) biometry using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Until now, segmentation of the CM is often performed manually using either custom-developed programs or image processing software. Here we present a novel software for semi-automatic segmentation of the ciliary muscle. It provides direct import of OCT images in DICOM format, a standardized procedure for segmentation, image distortion correction, the export of CM landmarks, like ciliary muscle apex and scleral spur, as well as a continuous thickness profile of the ciliary muscle as a novel way of analysis. Additionally, it supports batch processing for the automated analysis of large numbers of images. CilOCT was successfully applied in several studies:
